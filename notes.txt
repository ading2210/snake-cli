Data format for the board:
 - -2 = barrier
 - -1 = food
 - 0 = nothing
 - 1+ = part of the snake - the number represents the number of ticks until the snake part disappears

Data format for options menu items:
 - Multiple choice
  {
    "name": "multiple choice",
    "id":"multple_choice",
    "type": "choice",
    "choices": ["a", "b", "c"],
    "default": "a"
  }
 - True/False
  {
    "name": " true/false",
    "id":"boolean",
    "type": "toggle",
    "default": "True"
  }

Note for generic menu items:
 - Both str and dict work, the only thing that is displayed for dicts is the "name" value

TODO:
 - make sure player doesn't get softlocked in barrier mode
 - make sure barriers dont touch each other
